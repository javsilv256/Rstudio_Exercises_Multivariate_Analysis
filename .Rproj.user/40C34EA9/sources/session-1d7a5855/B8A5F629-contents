abstract: The objective of the exercise is to practice Cox-regression. It starts doing a survival curve (K-M) for all the sample, then by group of treatment. Finally we need to create the Cox-regression model using the classical approach to select the variables that will be part of the model.

### Starting the Exercise

Indications:

The data in ExerciseII.xls are results of an (hypothetical) observational cancer trial. The aim of the study was to compare two treatment strategies for a brain tumour: one of consists of local radiation (control regimen), one of a combination of local radiation and aggressive chemotherapy (test regimen). The endpoint of the study was survival duration after therapy.

Use R to explore the data. Describe the patient demographics and survival using Kaplan-Meier curves. Do you think that the test regimen prolongs survival? Analyze the data further using Cox-regression. Describe your conclusions.

## Important initial information

Analysis variable: Time to death

Initial time: When the treatment begins

End time: time of dead

Independent variable: Type of treatment (local radiation vs local+chemotherapy)
:::

#### Step 1

First we import the data from an excel file

```{r}
library(readxl)
ExerciseII <- read_excel("C:/Users/pined/OneDrive - Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos/Javier 2022/Belgica/AC2/Survival Analysis Exercise Database/Exercises/ExerciseII.xls")
```

To start working with survival analysis we need an event variable (1 when the event happened, otherwise 0)

In this case we already have the "died" variable

#### Step 2

Doing the Kaplan-Meyer curve (survival curve) for all the sample

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#Code for K-M curve
library(survival)
mod0 <- survfit(Surv(time, died) ~ 1, data=ExerciseII)
```

```{r}
#Code for Kaplan-Meyer Graph
plot(mod0, mark.time=TRUE)
```

#### Step 3

Kaplan-Meyer curve (survival curve) by group of treatment

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#Code for K-M curve
mod1 <- survfit(Surv(time, died) ~ trt, data=ExerciseII)

#Code for Kaplan-Meyer Graph
plot(mod1, mark.time=TRUE, lty=1:2)
legend ("top", legend=unique(ExerciseII$trt), lty=1:2)
```

We can also see the numbers of the graphic

```{r}
mod1
```

::: callout-tip
## Interpretation

In Treatment 0 (local radiation): 50% of the population was alive at day 512

In Treatment 1 (local + chemoteraphy): 50% of the population was alive at day 434

So, at first glance, it seems that in treatment 1, people tend to die faster. Is this true?? *We cannot say yet, we need to do the multivariate analysis with other variables that may be intervening*
:::

#### Step 4

Creating Cox Regression model (using the classical model)

4.1 Creating Cox regression with each of the (possible) predictors separately (bivariate analysis):

::: callout-tip
The Possible predictors could be: gender, trt and type

All those could be predictors or counfounders because this is not a clinical trial. (In a clinical trial the amount of persons in each group is fixed)
:::

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#Creating the Cox models for each variable (bivariate)
library(survival)
Cox1<- coxph(Surv(time, died) ~ trt, data=ExerciseII)
Cox2<- coxph(Surv(time, died) ~ gender, data=ExerciseII)
Cox3<- coxph(Surv(time, died) ~ type, data=ExerciseII)

summary(Cox1)
summary(Cox2)
summary(Cox3)

```

::: callout-tip
## Results from above

| Factor |  HR   |    95% IC    | p-value  |
|:------:|:-----:|:------------:|:--------:|
|  trt   | 1.264 | 1.028 1.554  |  0.0264  |
| gender | 1.034 | 0.8446 1.266 |  0.747   |
|  type  | 3.519 |  2.83 4.376  | \< 2e-16 |

Now we have to select those with p \< 0.200 (or 0.100 depending on our analysis plan) for further modeling

This means that all variables with p \< 0.200 (type) are potential factors that could be in our final model.

We also keep "trt" because it is the main independent variable
:::

4.2 Entering the selected variables in a multivariable model and then removing the non-significant factors one by one (always removing the least significant factor). "Backwards elimination"

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#Creating the Cox model for all selected variables (multivariate)
library(survival)
Cox4<- coxph(Surv(time, died) ~ trt + type , data=ExerciseII)
summary(Cox4)
```

::: callout-tip
## Reply

Both independant variable (trt and type) are significant (p value = 2.06e-06 and \< 2e-16 )

So we need to keep both independent variables. But, are they ok like that, or there is an interaction?
:::

4.3 Checking for interaction

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#Creating the Cox model for all selected variables considering interaction
Cox5<- coxph(Surv(time, died) ~ trt * type , data=ExerciseII)
summary(Cox5)
```

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Things to keep in mind

It seems that with the treatment effect interaction it is no longer significant (HR: 0.8987, pvalue= 0.6260), but it is not true.

Because we're introducing the interaction, when we see the HR = 0.8987 it's the HR for the local cancer only.
:::

::: callout-tip
## Reply

The data from the model is:

|  Factor  |   HR   |
|:--------:|:------:|
|   trt    | 0.8987 |
|   type   | 5.8185 |
| trt:type | 0.5270 |

But to know the correct HR of trt we have to add the HR of the interaction:

. HR of trt = 0.899\^trt \* 0.5270\^(trt\*type)

HR trt in local cancer = 0.899\^trt \* 0.5270\^(trt*0) HR trt in local cancer = 0.899\^trt* 1 HR trt in local cancer = 0.899

HR trt for metastatic cancer = 0.899\^trt \* 0.5270\^(trt*type) HR trt for metastatic cancer = 0.899\^trt* 0.5270\^(trt*1) HR trt for metastatic cancer = 0.899* 0.527 HR trt for metastatic cancer = 0.473
:::

4.4 We need to compare both models to check if the model with interaction is significantly better

```{r}
anova(Cox5, Cox4, test="Chisq")
```

::: callout-tip
## Reply

There is a significant difference with and without interaction models (p = 0.01725). So we keep the interaction.
:::

4.5 To present better the data with interaction is better to divide the dataset according each group of interaction and to present the model separately.

Creating subsets according each group of interaction:

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
table(ExerciseII$type)
LocalCancer  <-  subset(ExerciseII, type==0)  #Creating a database for local cancer
Metastatic  <-  subset(ExerciseII, type==1)    #Creating a database for metastatic
```

Checking the kaplan-meyer curve and cox regressión in each subset

4.5.1 IN LOCAL CANCER

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#Kaplan-Meyer curve
modLC <- survfit(Surv(time, died) ~ trt, data=LocalCancer)
plot(modLC, mark.time=TRUE, lty=1:2)
legend ("top", legend=unique(LocalCancer$trt), lty=1:2)
```

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#Cox Regression
CoxLC<- coxph(Surv(time, died) ~ trt, data=LocalCancer)
summary(CoxLC)
```

::: callout-tip
## Interpretation:

HR local cancer = 0.90 IC95%(0.5877 1.387)

Among those with local cancer, the ones that undergo the new treatment has 10% less hazard of die than the ones that went with the traditional treatment.But this is not significant.

That is the same to say:

Among those with local cancer, getting the new treatment reduces your hazard of dying by 10%. But this is not significant.
:::

4.4.2 IN METASTATIC CANCER

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#Kaplan-Meyer curve
modMC <- survfit(Surv(time, died) ~ trt, data=Metastatic)
plot(modMC, mark.time=TRUE, lty=1:2)
legend ("top", legend=unique(Metastatic$trt), lty=1:2)
```

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#Cox regressión
CoxMC<- coxph(Surv(time, died) ~ trt, data=Metastatic)
summary(CoxMC)
```

::: callout-tip
## Interpretation:

HR metastatic cancer = 0.46 IC95% (0.3504 0.6137)

Among those with metastasis cancer, the ones that undergo the new treatment has 54% less hazard of die than the ones that went with the traditional treatment.

That is the same to say:

Among those with metastasis cancer, getting the new treatment reduces your hazard of dying by 54%

HR local cancer = 0.90
