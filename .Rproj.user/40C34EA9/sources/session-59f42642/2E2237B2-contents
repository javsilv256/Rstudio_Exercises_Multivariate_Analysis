## Step by Step - Selection of variables for modeling

##### Import data

Importing a CSV database under the name of "onch1302", with "," as separator:

```{r}
onch1302 <- read.csv("C:/Users/pined/OneDrive - Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos/Javier 2022/Belgica/AC2/Logistic Regresion Exercise Database/Datasets/onch1302.csv", sep=",")
```

### Starting the Exercise (MVA_LogReg_Ex1-2023):

<sub> Onchocerciasis (commonly known as River Blindness) is a chronic filarial disease found in sub-Saharan Africa and some parts of Central and South America. An onchocerciasis project was set up in 1982 in the Bo district of Sierra Leone. The aims of the project were to study epidemiological, clin-ical, immunological and entomological aspects of the disease. Prevalence surveys were undertaken in villages selected on the basis of potential high endemicity, being situated on or near rivers which are the breeding sites for the Simulium damnosum blackfly. Of the twelve villages included in the present dataset, five were situated in the south and east of the country in the `forest' zone and the other seven were in the`savannah' zone of the country. A census was taken of each village, and all villagers over the age of five years were asked to participate in the study. Coverage was over 90% in all but one of the selected villages. Diagnosis was made by taking a skin-snip, and clinical and an ocular examination were also performed. The file ONCH1302 contains data for all 1,302 subjects. </sub>

<sub> This time you are asked to make two logistic regression models, first using classical model selection, then change-in-estimate model selection for the effect of area of residence (forest or savannah). Please answer the questions below. </sub>

#### Part 1

###### 1. Which are the steps you will go through for classical model selection?

We did this in previous excercises

###### 2. Please start by making a table describing the study population. Remember that to get tables with percentages you can use the "proportions" or "prop.table" function around a table (both functions are the same)

2.1 Modifing variables to work correctly

```{r}
onch1302$female <- factor(onch1302$sex, labels = c("male", "female"))
onch1302$forest <- factor(onch1302$area, labels = c("savanna", "forest"))

onch1302$agegrp <- factor(onch1302$agegrp, labels = c("(5-9)", "(10-19)", "(20-29)", "(40+)"))
onch1302$mf <- factor(onch1302$mf, labels = c("non-cases", "cases"))
onch1302$mfload <- factor(onch1302$mfload, labels = c("(none)", "(1-9)", "(10-49)", "(50+)"))
onch1302$lesions <- factor(onch1302$lesions, labels = c("no", "yes"))
```

```{r}
#Lesions
table(onch1302$lesions, useNA = "always")     #frecuency
prop.table(table(onch1302$lesions))           #proportion

#female
table(onch1302$female, useNA = "always")     #frecuency
prop.table(table(onch1302$female))           #proportion

#Forest
table(onch1302$forest, useNA = "always")     #frecuency
prop.table(table(onch1302$forest))           #proportion

#Agegr
table(onch1302$agegrp, useNA = "always")     #frecuency
prop.table(table(onch1302$agegrp))           #proportion

#Microfilaria
table(onch1302$mf, useNA = "always")     #frecuency
prop.table(table(onch1302$mf))           #proportion

#Microfilaria Load
table(onch1302$mfload, useNA = "always")     #frecuency
prop.table(table(onch1302$mfload))           #proportion

```

###### 3. Next step is to explore the bivariate associations with the outcome variable, microfilarial infection. Please explore these associations using bivariate logistic regression models and construct an appropriate table. Though odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals show which coefficients are significant, please add a column with p-values from the likelihood ratio test so we can decide which factors to test in our multivariate mode

::: callout-note
Example of interpretation: Among the non-cases only 3.9% had lesions
:::

###### 4. Which variables will you include in the multivariate model? Should eye lesions be included?

::: callout-note
All variable had a p-value of the LRTest less than 0.10 Even though because of the nature of the research, we are looking for epidemiological exposures of microfilaria, eye lesions are not an exposure are more a symptom/sign
:::

###### 5. Fit the model with 'age group' as factor, 'forest' and 'female', which is now the weakest factor (highest p-value)? Does dropping it make the model significantly less precise? Present the final model in a table.

```{r}
lm5 <- glm(mf ~ agegrp + forest + female, family=binomial, data=onch1302)
summary(lm5)
exp(coef(lm5))
exp(confint(lm5))
```

::: callout-note
In lm5 the variable with the highest p-value is female (p value = 1.82e-05). So we will do a new model without female and then compare it with lm5 to see if it caused a significant change
:::

```{r}
lm6 <- glm(mf ~ agegrp + forest, family=binomial, data=onch1302)
anova(lm5, lm6, test="Chisq")

```

::: callout-note
The p value of the Likelihood ratio test is 1.521e-05 (p \< 0.001), So, when I eliminate female, it changes the model significant making it less precise. So we cannot eliminate female.

The model we will stick with is the more complex lm5 (mf \~ agegrp + forest + female) The table of OR of lm5 is:

| Factor (n=1302)      | OR (95% CI)                        |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|
| Female gender        | 0.5591696 (0.4279198 0.7284977)    |
| Age group: 5-9 years | 2.5673568 (1.6627984 4.0044862)    |
| 10-19 years          | 2.5673568 (1.6627984 4.0044862)    |
| 20-39 year           | 10.4623748 (6.9776128 15.9588558)  |
| 40 years and above   | 17.6593452 (11.6370517 27.2821110) |
| Living in forest     | 3.0731378 (2.3475876 4.0437091)    |
:::

###### 6. Which are the three potential interactions? Does any of them significantly improve the model? If so, make a table with the odds ratio's in which you have taken into account the interaction.

For this section we need to test is the variables are ok in that way (lm5) or there are interaction. We will compare lm5 with models with interactions

6.1 Model with forest\*female as interaction

```{r}
lm7 <- glm(mf ~ agegrp + forest*female , family=binomial, data=onch1302)
anova(lm5, lm7, test="Chisq")
```

::: callout-note
The p-value of the Likelihood ratio test is 0.03588 (Lower than 0.05). So, it changes the model significant. So there is an interaction between forest\*female We will keep this model
:::

6.2 Model with agegrp\*forest as interaction

```{r}
lm8 <- glm(mf ~ agegrp*forest + female , family=binomial, data=onch1302)
anova(lm5, lm8, test="Chisq")
```

::: callout-note
The p-value of the Likelihood ratio test is 0.1544 (Higher than 0.05). So, it does not changes the model significant. So there is not an interaction between agegrp\*forest
:::

6.3 Model with agegrp\*female as interaction

```{r}
lm9 <- glm(mf ~ forest + agegrp*female , family=binomial, data=onch1302)
anova(lm5, lm9, test="Chisq")
```

::: callout-note
The p-value of the Likelihood ratio test is 0.1813 (Higher than 0.05). So, it does not changes the model significant. So there is not an interaction between agegrp\*female
:::

6.3 Filling the table requested Because we now know that we have an interaction : forest\*female, is better to calculate the OR by categories of the interaction. We could decide to split the data by (women-men) or by (living/ not living in the forest). The most usual is present the results by sex, so:

```{r}
table(onch1302$female)
women  <-  subset(onch1302, female=="female")  #Creating a database for only women
men  <-  subset(onch1302, female=="male")    #Creating a database for only male
```

The model in women

```{r}
lm10 <- glm(mf ~ agegrp + forest , family=binomial, data=women)
exp(coef(lm10))
exp(confint(lm10))
```

The model in man

```{r}
lm11 <- glm(mf ~ agegrp + forest , family=binomial, data=men)
exp(coef(lm11))
exp(confint(lm11))
```

::: callout-note
| Factor (n=1302)     | Women (n=686) OR (95% CI)            | Men (N=616) OR (95% CI)           |
|------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Age group:5-9 years |                                      |                                   |
| 10-19 year          | 2.13748276 (1.13270252 4.1137899)    | 3.1894477 (1.7572835 5.9066602)   |
| 20-39 year          | 10.48287813 (5.97014423 19.1384989)  | 11.5596717 (6.4172108 21.4996506) |
| 40 years +          | 23.11558852 (12.62532875 44.0769379) | 13.8388609 (7.8746659 25.0737487) |
| Living in forest    | 4.15267371 (2.85704938 6.1178354)    | 2.1425002 (1.4425398 3.1999460)   |

The effect of living in the forest is different for women from men The Odds of having the disease is 4. times as high if you are women living in the forest than women living in savana The Odds of having the disease is 2. times as high if you are men living in the forest than men living in savana

This is because female is an interaction factor (The interaction test (likelihood ratio test) was significant)
:::

#### Part 2

Change-in-Estimate model (it change the primary OR exposure) 1. We select the factor that can be exposures and the main exposure: Can we change it? 2. First the crude odd ratio bivariate outcome - primary exposure

```{r}
mod_crude <- glm(mf ~ forest, family=binomial, data=onch1302)
```

3.  Then adding one variable at the time and writing it down.

```{r}
mod_1 <- glm(mf ~ forest + sex, family=binomial, data=onch1302)
mod_2 <- glm(mf ~ forest + agegrp, family=binomial, data=onch1302)
```

| Factor           | Co-factor     | OR   | Change (Original OR - New OR)/Original OR |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Living in forest |               | 2.41 |                                           |
| Living in forest | Female gender | 2.40 | = (2.41 - 2-40)/ 2.41                     |
|                  |               |      | = 0.4%                                    |
| Living in forest | Age group     | 3.08 | = (3.08 - 2-41)/ 2.41                     |
|                  |               |      | = 27.8%                                   |

4.  So the final model for now is: mod_2 \<- glm(mf \~ forest + agegrp, family=binomial, data=onch1302)

5.  Tring adding interaction effects If we want to check for interaction, is better to have no so may categories. So we will dichotomize agegroup

```{r}
#Adult variable (adult=1, non adult=0)
  onch1302$adult <- ifelse(onch1302$agegrp>1,1,0)
```

We compare with the likelihood ratio test the one without interaction (mf \~ forest + agegrp) and the one with interaction (mf \~ forest \* agegrp)

The p value is not significant, so we keep with te more simple (mf \~ forest \* agegrp)

###### 7.Now that you have made the final predictive model (using the classical moldel), let's continue with an explanatory model for the effect of living in the forest versus the savannah. Which factors should we consider? We will follow these steps:

1.  Fit a model containing only the primary exposure variable of interest; write down the effect size, which is the crude OR.
2.  construct models with two variables, including the primary exposure and another exposure; identify confounders by comparing crude with adjusted ORs
3.  construct saturated model containing all exposure variables which resulted in a 10% change in effect size of the primary exposure (ref. step 2)
4.  eliminate exposure variables one after the other, but do not eliminate established confounders; retain exposure variable if removing it resulted in a 10% change in effect size of the primary exposure (ref. step 3)
5.  Explore interaction between primary exposure and other exposure variables; neglect other types of interaction

###### 8. Present a table with results of logistic regressions on forest alone, forest + female and forest + age group. Did the odds ratios of forest change as a result of this control for confounding?

###### 9. Gender is not a confounder, but age group is. Normally this would be the end of our procedure. However, we would also like to explore interaction effects between the primary exposure and each of the confounders. This is best done by recoding age group to two levels, creating a variable 'adult' set to 'FALSE' if age is 0-19 years and 'TRUE' if age is 20 years or above. Is 'adult' or 'female' an effect modifier in the association between 'forest' and disease?
