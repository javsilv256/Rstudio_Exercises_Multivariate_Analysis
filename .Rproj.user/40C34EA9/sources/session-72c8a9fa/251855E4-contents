## Step by Step

##### Import data

Importing a CSV database under the name of "evans", with "," as separator and "." as decimal:

```{r}
evans <- read.csv("C:/Users/pined/OneDrive - Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos/Javier 2022/Belgica/AC2/Exercise and Datasets/Datasets/evans_county.csv", sep=",", dec= ".")
```

We assume that all variables ok to start (we dont need to transform or create variables)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Starting the Exercise:

Is the Queteled Index(QTI) associated with systolic blood pressure(SBP)?

Independent variable: QTI

Dependent variable: SBP

##### 0. It is a good practice to explore the data. In this case with a scatterplot

```{r}
#Code in R:          
  # Make a scatterplot
  plot(evans$QTI, evans$SBP, main="Scatterplot")
  # add a regression line
  abline(lm(SBP~QTI, data = evans), col = "blue")
```

::: callout-note
  -We can see that there could be a correlation, although it seen not very strong
::: 

##### 1. What is the regressión equation?

```{r}
#Code for linear regresion:
  lmQTI = lm(SBP ~ QTI, data = evans)
  summary(lmQTI)
```

::: callout-note
  -As a result: we can create the equation with the data we obtained

    * Formula:  y = a+b(x)
    * a = 129.420
    * b = 4.439
        (b is the slope, 
        it means that for every increase of 1 in QTI the SBP increase in 4.43)
    
    So, the equation would be:
    * Y= 129.420 + 4.439(X)
::: 


##### 2. How much is the determination coefficient? What does it mean?

::: callout-note
  -The determination coefficient is R2 = 0.009 
  
    Interpretation: 
    " __%  of the variability of the outcome could be explained by the model "
    "0.9% of the variability of the SBP(blood preasure) could be explained by the model"
::: 

##### 3. Is the slope for QTI statiscally significant?

::: callout-note
  -The slope for QTI is 4.439
  -And its p value is 0.0183 (less than 0.05)
  
    Interpretation: 
    *P value in this case says that there is a statisticas association (that is the same that       says that "the slope of the regresion line is significanly different from zero)
::: 

### Testing the assumptions (linearity, homogeneity of variance, normality...)

First we need to calculate the residuals an calculate the estimated outcome(fitted) as new variables

```{r}
evans$mod_resid <- residuals(lmQTI)
evans$mod_fitted <- fitted(lmQTI)
```

##### 4. Is the association betwenn SBP and QTI a linear association?

We scatterplot the residuals against the exposure(VI)

```{r}
#Code in R:          
  # Make a scatterplot
  plot(evans$QTI, evans$mod_resid, main="Scatterplot")
  # add a regression line
  abline(lm(mod_resid~QTI, data = evans), col = "blue")
```
::: callout-note
    We scatterplot the residuals against the exposure(VI) 
    In this case because we see it as a cloud, then we assume linearity
::: 

##### 5. Is the variance of the residuals homogeneous?

We scatterplot the residuals against the estimated outcome(fitted)
```{r}
#Code in R:          
  # Make a scatterplot
  plot(evans$mod_fitted, evans$mod_resid, main="Scatterplot")
  # add a regression line
  abline(lm(mod_resid ~ mod_fitted, data = evans), col = "blue")
```
::: callout-note
    We residuals against the estimated outcome(fitted)
    In this case because we see it as a cloud, then we assume homogeneity
::: 

##### 6. Are the residuals normally distributted?

```{r}
#Doing an histogram of the residuals
  hist(evans$mod_resid,main="Age distribution of study participants", 
     xlab="Age (years)", ylab="nb", col="green", border="dark green")
```
::: callout-note
    Seems not
::: 


##### 7. Are the observations independent?
::: callout-note
    We dont need any calculation for this.
    Because we are not working with sequential measures (in time or in space):
      The observations  are  independent
::: 

##### 8. Are there any extreme values?
::: callout-note
    For this we need to made a scatter plot of the residuals against the estimated outcome (fitted) (we already did this in step 5 )
    
    For discussion. It seems to have some extreme values.
::: 

##### 9. Are there any influential observation?
::: callout-note
    For this we need to made a scatter plot of the residuals against the exposure (we already did this in step 4 )
    
    For discussion. It seems to have some influential observations.
::: 


##### 10. Does the model significantly improve when the variable AGE is added?
We do this doing an multivariate linear regresion

```{r}
#Code for linear regresion:
  lmQTI_AGE = lm(SBP ~ QTI+AGE, data = evans)
  summary(lmQTI_AGE)
```


::: callout-note
-A. As a result: we can create the new formula with the data we obtained

    * y = a + b1(x1) + b2(x2)
    * a= 73.4912
    * b1 = 5.6031
    * b2 = 0.9630
    So, the formula would be:
    * Y= 73.4912 + 5.6031(QTI) + 0.9630(AGE)
    
-B. We also find the R2 

    * R2 is the "Determination coefficient". 
    * R2 =  0.1136
    Interpretation: 
    "11% of the variability of the SBP could be explained by the model"

-C. Does the model significantly improve when the variable AGE is added? 

    * It improves, but I dont know if it is a significantly improvement. 
::: 

To know if it is a significantly improvement, we can do an anova table comparing the 2 models
```{r}
#Code for ANOVA
    anova (lmQTI,lmQTI_AGE)
```
::: callout-note
p = 2.2e-16
The second model has a significant difference to the first model, so including AGE has increased significantly the model.
::: 


##### 11. Which proportion of the variability in SBP is explained by this model?

::: callout-note
We already did it at step 10
    * R2 is the "Determination coefficient". 
    * R2 =  0.1136
    Interpretation: 
    "11% of the variability of the SBP could be explained by the model"
::: 

##### 12. Please write down the equation of the model
::: callout-note
We already did it at step 10
    * y = a + b1(x1) + b2(x2)
    * a= 73.4912
    * b1 = 5.6031
    * b2 = 0.9630
    So, the formula would be:
    * Y= 73.4912 + 5.6031(QTI) + 0.9630(AGE)
:::
