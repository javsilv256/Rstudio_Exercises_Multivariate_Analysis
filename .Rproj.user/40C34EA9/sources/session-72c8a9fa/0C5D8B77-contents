## Step by Step

##### Import data

Importing a CSV database under the name of "cholest", with "," as separator and "." as decimal:

```{r}
cholest <- read.csv("C:/Users/pined/OneDrive - Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos/Javier 2022/Belgica/AC2/Exercise and Datasets/Datasets/Cholesterol.csv", sep=",", dec= ".")
```

### Starting the Exercise:

We want to respond to the question: How do we best explain the variability of cholesterol with the data we have?

##### 1. We explore the variables - Cleaning

1.1 Cholesterol

```{r}
hist(cholest$cholesterol)
```

::: callout-note
-Cholesterol seems ok
:::

1.2 Activity

```{r}
hist(cholest$activity)
summary(cholest$activity)
```

::: callout-note
-Activity seems ok
:::

1.3 Occupation

1.3.1 First we see the values of the variable if they make sense

```{r}
table(cholest$occupation)
```

::: callout-note
-Seems ok, Occupation only have 4 categories, and there are 4 categories in my data
:::

1.3.2 Second we see if the variable is in a categorical or numerical way as I want. Ocupation is in a numerical way, need to change it to a factor

```{r}
cholest$occupation_f <- factor(cholest$occupation)
```

1.3.2 Then, we have to be sure that the first category of the variable should be the reference category

```{r}
#
cholest$occupation_f <- factor(cholest$occupation)
```

::: callout-note
-activity seems ok
:::

##### Doing the modeling - linear regresion - Method: Change-in-estimate model

Model with inly the primary expouse variable

```{r}
mod1 <- lm(cholesterol ~ activity, data=cholest)
summary(mod1)
```

Model with two independent variables

```{r}
mod2 <- lm(cholesterol ~ activity + age, data=cholest)
mod3 <- lm(cholesterol ~ activity + bmi_cat, data=cholest)
mod4 <- lm(cholesterol ~ activity + sex_f, data=cholest)
mod5 <- lm(cholesterol ~ activity + occupation_f, data=cholest)
```

summary(mod2) summary(mod3) summary(mod4) summary(mod5)

After see the % of change we see that only "activity+age" and "activity+BMI" has a change % higher than 10

Multivariate model

```{r}
mod6 <- lm(cholesterol ~ activity + age + bmi_cat, data=cholest)
summary(mod6)
```

The adjusted effect of activity is: -0.016

Multivatiate model without age

```{r}
mod7 <- lm(cholesterol ~ activity + bmi_cat, data=cholest)
summary(mod7)
```

The adjusted effect of activity now is: -0.029

Is that a substancial change? (-0.029 - -0.016)/-0.016 81% Yes, it is a substancial change, so we shoulnt take age of the equation

Multivatiate model without bmi

```{r}
mod8 <- lm(cholesterol ~ activity + age, data=cholest)
summary(mod8)
```

The adjusted effect of activity now is: -0.017

Is that a substancial change? (-0.017 - -0.016)/-0.016 6% No, it is not a substancial change, so we can take BMI of the equation

So the final model (the more simple) is cholesterol \~ activity + age Mod8
