## Multivariate Analysis Course

Welcome to the Lecture notes for the Multivariate Analysis Course at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp. These notes were made by ***Javier Silva-Valencia*** as reference for the solutions to the exercises given in class. 

All lecture notes and this webpage were created using RStudio with Quarto. (I didn't know it could do that either.) It's not perfect, but I hope it's useful!

If you find any errors, please let me know, thanks!
