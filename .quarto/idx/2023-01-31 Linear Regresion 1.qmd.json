It is a moderate strong positive correlation\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Step 2\nDoing the Scatterplot\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: fenced\n#Code in R:          \n  # Make a scatterplot\n  plot(lbwpmor$inclbw, lbwpmor$permor, main=\"Title\")\n  # add a regression line\n  abline(lm(permor~inclbw, data = lbwpmor), col = \"blue\")\n```\n\n::: callout-tip\nAs a result: we can see in the graph the linear positive correlation\n:::\n\n\n#### Step 3\n\nDoing the Linear regresion for only inclbw and permor (bivariate)\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: fenced\n#Code in R:\nlmHeight = lm(permor ~ inclbw, data = lbwpmor)\nsummary(lmHeight)\n```\n\n::: callout-tip\n-A. As a result: we can recreate the formula with the data we obtained\n\n    * y = a+b(x)\n    * a= 0.42139\n    * b = 0.14677 (slope)\n    So, the formula would be:\n    * Y= 0.42 +0.147(X)\n      \n\n-B. We also find the R2\n\n    * R2 is the \"Determination coefficient\". \n    * R2 =  0.4708\n    Interpretation: \n    \"47% of the variability of the mortality could be explained by the model\"\n        \n\n-C. We also find the p value = 0.000837\n\n    Interpretation:\n    *P value in this case says that there is a statisticas association between mortality\n    and low birth weight (that is the same that says that \"the slope of the regresion line \n    is significanly different from zero)\n        \n\n-D. As another result we have the \"correlation coefficient\"\n\n    Remember that we calculate the correlation coefficiente before in part 1 (\"1. Finding\n    Correlation\"). But we can also calculate here because: \n          Correlation coefficient = Square root of R2\n    So:\n          Correlation coefficient (r) = Sqrt(0.4708)\n          Correlation coefficient (r) = 0.6861\n    Interpretation: \n        \"The value of 0.68 suggest a strong positive association\"\n:::\n\n#### Step 4\nPredict \"y\" when X is \"8\"\n\nBefore we have already calculated the formula: \"Y= 0.42 +0.147(X)\" So we just need to replace the \"X\"\n\n```{r}\n#Calculate:\n0.42 +(0.147*8)\n```\n\n::: callout-tip\nSo, using the Linear regression formula above we can say that\n\n    When \"low birth weight\" is 8 \n    the \"perinatal mortality\" may be 1.596\n:::\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":true,"code-line-numbers":true,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"toc-depth":4,"reference-location":"margin","filters":["lightbox"],"self-contained":true,"output-file":"2023-01-31 Linear Regresion 1.html"},"language":{"title-block-author-single":"Writer"},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","editor":"visual","knitr":{"opts_chunk":{"cache":true,"cache.lazy":false,"R.options":{"knitr.graphics.auto_pdf":true},"attr.source":".numberLines"}},"theme":{"light":"flatly"},"fontsize":"16px","linestretch":1.6,"smooth-scroll":true,"title":"2023-01-31.
