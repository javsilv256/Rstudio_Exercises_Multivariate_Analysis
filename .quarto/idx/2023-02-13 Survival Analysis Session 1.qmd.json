Which of the following types of data can/should be analyzed using survival analysis? What would be the analysis variable? What is the time of origin and the end point? Are the data censored, and if yes, which type of censoring occurs?\n\na)  Two groups of patients with skin cancer are treated: group A gets surgical removal of the cancer, group B gets surgical removal + chemotherapy. We believe that the chemotherapy will reduce the risk of recurrence of he cancer. The patients are asked to return for a check up every 3 months for the following 5 years. At every check-up, the patients are examined for skin cancers.\n\n::: callout-note\n    A. Should be analyzed using survival analysis?: Yes.\n\n        Why?, Because we are interested in the time from one event to another and also could be censoring (when we dont know when is the end point)\n        \n        Why not linear regression: Because there could be censoring in the data. There is a possibility that not all continues the follow-up or finish the study without having the event\n\n    B. Analysis variable: Time to cancer recurrence\n\n    C. Times\n\n      Time of origin: Time when undergoing the intervention\n\n      End poing: Time of the recurrence of the cancer\n\n    D. Are the data censored?: Yes, censoring in survival analysis refers to the situation in which the exact time to event is not known for some individuals in a study.\n\n        What type of censoring occurs?: Interval, because if you are studying the recurrence of cancer, you do not know if it just appeared before the appointment Also, the point where the cancer begins is not well defined.\n:::\n\nb)  Two groups of patients with malaria are entered in a clinical trial: 1 group receives a new treatment, the other group receives standard care. After 3 months they are asked to return for parasitological examination. We want to see if the new treatment cures more patient than standard therapy.\n\n::: callout-note\n    A. Should be analyzed using survival analysis?: No, our outcome doesnt involve time. It is just one measure.\n\n      For this we should use Logistic Regression. Because the outcome is a binary variable\n\n    B. Analysis variable: % of patiens parasite-free at month 3\n:::\n\nc)  To assess risk behaviour for HIV and other STI's, a group of adolescents (12 to 18 years) are asked when they had sexual intercourse for the first time. We are interested in estimating the age of sexual debut.\n\n::: callout-note\n    A. Should be analyzed using survival analysis?: Yes, our outcome is the time of sexual debut. We are interested in the time from one event to another. Also the data could be censored\n\n    B. Analysis variable: Age of sexual debut\n\n    C. Times\n      \n        Time of origin: Born\n\n        End poing: Age of sexual debut\n\n    D: Is the data censored?: Yes. There may be adolescents who have not yet had sexual relations at the time of the survey.\n\n      This is a cross-sectional study but you ask for a time.\n\n        What type of censoring occurs? Right, by some adolescents who have not yet had sexual relations at the time of the survey\n        \n:::\n\nd)  To assess risk behaviours for childhood asthma, we perform a case-control study comparing mothers of children with asthma and children without asthma. We ask the mothers when they were first pregnant. We are interested in estimating the age of first pregnancy for women with a child with asthma vs women with a child without asthma\n\n::: callout-note\n    A. Could be analyzed using survival analysis?: Yes (we are interested in the time from one event to another. But because we dont have censoring we can use also linear regresion)\n\n    B. Analysis variable: Age at first pregnancy\n      \n      Independant variable: having or not a child with asthma\n\n    C. Times\n      \n        Time of origin: Birth\n\n        End poing: Age of first pregnancy\n\n\n    D. Are the data censored?: No, censoring is when we dont know the end point. In this case all women had a first pregnancy, so all have the outcome and we know when. Also, I cannot have a loss to follow-up, because it is a cross-sectional study.\n:::\n\n##### 2. We ran a clinical trial of a new less invasive surgical procedure (treatment A) for patients with myocardial infarction. This procedure is compared to the standard treatment (treatment B) which requires open-heart surgery. After surgery patients were required to return to the clinic every 3 months for a check-up. The trial was completed on 1-Jan-2006. The primary objective of the study is to compare the two treatment groups with respect to mortality, analyzed using an intention-to-treat approach. As a secondary analysis, time to cardiac event (defined as new MI or a new cardiac procedure or cardiac death) is analyzed, using a per-protocol approach.\n\n![Intention to treat vs Per protocol](Intention%20to%20treat.png)\n\n::: callout-note\nIn an intention-to-treat analysis, you analyze everyone according to the groups of the initial randomization. (Although in the end for X reasons some did not follow the planned treatment)\n\nIn a per-protocol analysis, you analyze only those who actually undergo according initial randomization.\n:::\n\n<sub>a.
