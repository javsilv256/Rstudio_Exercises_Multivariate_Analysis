The disease is known to disproportionally affect the poorest segments of society, this could be due to increased exposure to sand flies as a result of poor housing and environmental conditions. To assess the independent contributions of different factors, a study team conducted an entomological survey and collected information on housing and environmental conditions as well as on assets owned. Five hundred houses from a rural block were randomly sampled and light traps were installed simultaneously for a total of 6 nights in each house. Per house the total number of p. argentipes sand flies captured was determined. The data can be found in sandfly.csv. </sub>\n\n###### 1.

Construct a multiple linear regresion with all variables that were significant. Which variables will you include?\n\n<sub> We will incude those who obtained a p value less than 0.10: animals, ventilation, cowdung, asset index and house_type. The regresion model is: </sub>\n\n```{r}\nlm9 = lm(log_parg ~ animals + ventilation + cowdung + asset_index + house_type, data = sandfly)\nsummary(lm9)\n```\n\n###### 5. Which is the weaksest factor (highest p-value) and how high is its p-value?\n\n::: callout-note\nCowndown (has the higher pvalue 0.52641)\n\nClarification: If we see the previous results, In fact the one with the highest p-value is one category of house_type (brick_efloor: 0.89678). But because there are other categories of the same variable that are significant (has p value less than 0.05), we cannot eliminate that variable.\n:::\n\n###### 6. Remove 'cowdung', which is now the weakest factor and what is its p-value?\n\n<sub> So the next model is: </sub>\n\n```{r}\nlm10 = lm(log_parg ~ animals + ventilation + asset_index + house_type, data = sandfly)\nsummary(lm10)\n```\n\n::: callout-note\nVentilation (has now the higher pvalue 0.16636)\n\nClarification: If we see the previous results, in fact are others with a highest p-value (ej: asset_index2 or house_typepbrick_efloor). But because there are other categories of the same variable that are significant (has p value less than 0.05, we cannot eliminate that variable.\n:::\n\n###### 7. Remove 'ventilation'. Is there still another factor of which no category is significant at the 5% level ? Which factors do you keep in your final model?\n\n<sub> So the new model is: </sub>\n\n```{r}\nlm11 = lm(log_parg ~ animals + asset_index + house_type, data = sandfly)\nsummary(lm11)\n```\n\n::: callout-note\nAll have at least one category with a p-value \\< 0.05, So there is not another factor no significant and I dont have to exclude another variable\n\nSo, This factors are the ones who are going to stay in the final model: House_type, asset_index and animals.\n:::\n\n###### 8. To test for interactions generate the following binary variables:\n\n<sub> - rich, 'yes' if asset_index = 5, 'no' if asset-index = 1-4 (beware of missing values!) </sub>\n\n<sub> - thatched, 'yes' if house_type = 'thatched, else 'no'</sub>\n\n<sub> Run the model with 'animals', 'rich' and 'thatched' as predictors, note down the equation.

Theoretically there could be interactions between rich and thatched, rich and animals and animals and thatched.

As our final model we keep the model with type of house, asset-index and presence of animals.

How much of the variability in sand fly exposure is explained by the three factors retained? What would be your conclusion about exposure to sand flies in this rural area.\n\n::: callout-note\nR squared = 0.1231, so the model explains only 12% of the total variability.\n\n    - Being rich and living in a good house (Plastered brick earth floor or cemented\n      floor) reduces outcome, but far from being factors that play an important role.\n    - Could be other factors that play a role. \n:::\n\n###### 12. What is the predicted total number of sandflies in a thatched house with animals inside of a family belonging to the poorest quintile? And in a plastered brick house with cemented floor without animals and belonging to the wealthiest quintile?\n\n12.1 For the first condition:\n\n::: callout-note\nSo the conditions are:\n\n    - Animals in the hous: Yes\n    - House type: thatched house\n    - Assest index: 1 (poorest)\n\nSo the equation for lm11 should be\n\n      y = a + b1X1 + b2x2 + b3x3\n      y = a + b1(animals) + b2(assest_index) + b3 (house_type)\n      y = 3.129930 + 0.51(animals) + 0(assest_index:poorest) + 0.59(house_type:thatched)\n      y = 3.13     + 0.51(1)       + 0                       + 0.59(1)\n    log_parg = 4.23\n      #The \"log of parg\" is 4.23, but I need the value of parg\n    exp(log_parg) = exp(4.23)\n    parg = 69\n      #parg is 69 with this conditions\n:::\n\n12.2 For the second condition:\n\n::: callout-note\nSo the conditions are:\n\n    - Animals in the house: No\n    - House type: Plastered brick cemented floor\n    - Assest index: 5 (wealthiest)\n\nSo the equation for lm11 should be\n\n      y = a + b1X1 + b2x2 + b3x3\n      y = a + b1(animals) + b2(assest_index) + b3 (house_type)\n      y = 3.129930 + 0.51(animals) -0.38(wealthiest) + 0(Plastered brick cemented floor)\n      y = 3.13     + 0.51(0)       -0.38(1)          + 0\n    log_parg = 2.75\n      #The \"log of parg\" is 2.75 , but I need the value of parg\n    exp(log_parg) = exp(2.75)\n    parg = 16\n      #parg is 16 with this conditions\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n##### Extra\n\n::: callout-note\nIf we want to really check witch model is best than another (like in the step 9), we need to do a f test - anova function and see the p value:\n\n    anova(lm11, mod13)\n\nBut an error may show. When one of the variables that are in one model have missing values, R eliminate those rows when doing the model. So then if we want to compare, the models might not have the same number of rows and the test will fail.\n\nFor this is better to work with a subset of the data with no missing data in all the variables:\n\nSo if I know that asset_index has missing value, then:\n\n    sandfly_complete <- subset(sandfly, !is.na(sandfly$asset_index))\n    or\n    sandfly_complete <- subset(sandfly, complete.cases(sandfly))\n:::\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"self-contained":true,"output-file":"2023-02-03 Linear Regresion, Sessión 4.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","editor":"visual","theme":{"light":"flatly"},"title":"2023-02-03 Sessión 4"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
